# Implement a design from scratch :sparkles:

In this project at Holberton, we will be implementing a web page from scratch, using a Figma design file. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we learned previously.

We are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the [Figma designer file](https://www.figma.com/file/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ppGIbovIBhhSeO3t-0).

## General Requirements: 
- You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- You are not to use Javascript
- The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- Links hover/active: #FF6565
- Button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- Max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

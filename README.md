# Implement a design from scratch :sparkles:

In this project at Holberton, we will be implementing a web page from scratch, using a Figma design file. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we learned previously.

We are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. Below is the desired final result.
